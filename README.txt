Easily add terms to taxonomies in bulk

== Description ==

If you have a lot of terms that you need to add to tags, categories, or custom taxonomies... don't waste time doing it by hand! Bulk Term Generator makes it easy to do it all at once.

For example, let's say you have a custom taxonomy called Animal Types and you need to import every animal type known to man. To make matters worse, there's a hierarchy, so each animal (like "Dogs") have hundreds of breeds under it. Yikes.

Submitting each one individually (and waiting for the page to load each time) could take you forever.

Now there's a better way...

1. After installing the plugin, you choose which taxonomy you want to import terms to.
2. Copy/paste a list of terms you want to create. You can even specify the slug and description for each.
3. If you are dealing with a hierachy, continue to paste terms for each one, choosing which parent it belongs to.
4. You can see which terms will be added before they are generated. This gives you a chance to make any changes before the final step.
5. When you're ready, just hit the "Generate Terms" button, and you're done!
